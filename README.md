# Flare 🔥

**Flare** is a lightweight, experimental programming language written in Rust. Designed to be simple, fun, and easy to extend, it’s perfect for learning language design or building small projects.

---

## Features

* Minimal syntax inspired by modern languages
* Variables: `let` and `var`
* Functions and function calls
* Built-in `print` function
* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and interpreter written in Rust
* Extensible: can add GUI, loops, operators, and more in the future

---

## Example Program

```flare
fn main() {
    let x = 42
    print("Hello Flare! Value of x is ", x)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Flare! Value of x is 42
```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Rust 1.72+
* Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flare.git
cd flare
cargo run
```

You should see the tokens, AST, and program output printed in your terminal.
