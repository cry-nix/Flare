**Flare** is a simple but powerful programming language, it has the syntax of python but the power of c++, btw it's written in rust.

---

## Features

* Minimal syntax inspired by modern languages
* Variables: `let` and `var`
* Functions and function calls
* Built-in `print` function
* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and interpreter written in Rust
* Extensible: can add GUI, loops, operators, and more in the future

---

## Example Program

```flare
fn main() {
    let x = 42
    print("Hello Flare! Value of x is ", x)
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello Flare! Value of x is 42
```

---

## Future Plans

* Function parameters and return values
* Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* Control flow: `if`, `while`, `for`
* Standard library: strings, math, lists
* GUI package for Flare
* Graphics Library like (OpenGL but easier)
